Thanks to the bad weather, which has been classified as disaster, I've been able to say "tonight is the last night" for quite a few times.. good thing is I escaped for some time and bad thing is I suffered even longer.. but eventually here it comes;(  
Actually I came to Chicago in 2012, so it's just a little bit more than a year. Honestly, I haven't met a lot of people here as I always, you know, enjoy the time of being alone.. So what's the point? I should not feel anything.. also those people I met most frequently in the past year will come with me, so again, what's the point?

People have their own theory towards everything. Some people don't give it a shit for things like farewell. Some do value it quite a lot. I used to say "well well well, no worries, we'll meet again in near future", but gradually I find it's not always true and most of time, it's not true.. Some people are just *dead* in my life and I guess so am I in theirs. I never see them afterwards and I barely contact them, even for those whom I'm close with. The reason I guess is we are just not close enough to overcome the vast ocean, to overcome all the hurdle between us. or we might just not realize that we are close enough. For whatever reasons, it's a sad story. After realizing this, it becomes a really tough for me to say goodbye, to see those people around me, people who I met everyday *physically dead*, disappeared, jumping out of my life, in a single day, all of a sudden.. You know, everybody knows he gonna die eventually, but it's really hard for people to know that he will die *today*. ok at least for me, it is.  
I know people have been saying things like when you know death is coming, be brave enough to embark it, like a soldier or whatever(maybe a hacker? coz I guess they are facing death everyday when they work through the nigh..) Well, I agree.. but still I never get rid of the torture brought by the *farewell-death theory*.

Ok I feel like it gonna be a long post since more things start jumping into my head, which I didn't mean to do.. so let's just stop here.. Life is full of randomness, full of surprise, let's see what gonna happen;) be prepared;)

Oh one more thing.. ```Happy Birthday``` you know whom I'm taking about;)
