Well, at this very beginning, I think I should write down something more about this blog, both to give you a sense of what's going on here and more importantly;) to give myself a reminder about why and how I start it and also what should I put here. 

####why I start it?
- I know I keep forgetting things..  
I enjoy in quite a lot of things, sports like soccer, table tennis, badminton(since I was around 7 years old?), cycling, skiing(after I came to US) and more general things like traveling, photography. I do enjoy the time doing those things, but I also wanna try to archive them so I can share with my friends;)  
What else can i forget? Oh random thoughts.. they just jump into my head and disappear randomly, but some do worth taking a note of. Sometimes I even find my dream interesting and fortunately I still remember when I wake up.. for example like [this](/2013/12/29/做了一个梦).
- Keeping track of life  
I have a sina weibo(Chinese twitter) account and twitter randomly starting from two years ago(?) The other day, I felt bored.. and read they altogether(just a few hundreds short msgs), it was fun;) but the shortcoming is the words limit for each twitter, around 100 words? it's not enough for me sometime.. am I garrulous?:) so I guess a blog might be better. Another problem about the weibo is more and more followers know who I am.. while I prefer being some kind of invisible people.. like people doing a great work without anybody else's notice, like batman, spider man? but I guess my definition of great work might be different from theirs;) Yup, you never know great people are around you being like normal guys, you are protected;)

####how I build this blog?
I've been long trying to get myself a clean and descend blog since I don't want it to be painful looking my blog before reading anything.. I use to blog a little on wordpress, but only with what they provided. I'm pretty tired of the theme since I can always find quite a lot similar sites with the same style.. I know I was not a good blogger.. but I'll try to be a good one here;)

Early this year I found [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and was quite satisfied with what it provides;) but I didn't have too much time for it until the winter break(also because I'm lazy..)  
So basically, Jekyll defines some kind of grammar and file structure such that you can [blog like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html) sounds pretty cool, doesn't it?;) Next thing the theme, I read quite a lot of themes available online and found these two pretty handy, first is [rusty shutter](http://lhzhang.com/) and second is [kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper). So I combined them and got what you see here^_^

####what can you expect here
- things I enjoy doing.. 
- thoughts jumping into my mind..  
I'm also trying to build(or purchase) a gallery site for photos.. you can find an icon on top-right of this page. Basically I'm not going copy/paste content from other places but I'll share the link if I find it interesting;)

####more about me again?
ok, as you can easily infer, my name is Wenjie Luo.. I'm currently a graduate student in a PhD program. I guess that's enough for introduction?.. don't waste your time google ing me, you know
